    </ul>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;An interesting fact about me is that I am 50% Dutch as my father is 100% Dutch and from the Netherlands, a country in Europe. The very nice part about that is we tend to travel to Europe every so often to visit family as well as experience new places.</p>
