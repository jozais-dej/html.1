    <h2>Assignment 1:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I was familiar with much of the basic html language so writing this assignment didn't take to much trouble. The thing that I had difficulties with was figuring out who to set up the git web pages and being able to edit in visual studio. I eventually figured it out though as you can see with these pages.</li>
        <li>I think the thing that I really took away from this asignment was just to refamiliarize myself with html overall and since i've been refreshed I am excited for the rest of the course.</li>
        <li>One website I used called w3schools had a lot of bennificial information on how to insert images and links to other pages</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Assignment 2:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The things that were the most difficult for me i think were trying to figure out the correct proportions of everything, and since I am doing it through github pages, it is just a bit of a hasle when you want to check each specific change you make.</li>
        <li>I think the best think that I took away from this assignment was how to properly implement fonts with both css and html, there wansn't many things that were new to me. </li>
        <li>I useed w3schools again for this assignment, as well as some other websites to help me find specific colors and how to properly import thee google fonts.</li>
        <li>I had to google how to get the fonts to work properly because early on I was having a hard timee figuring out how to get them to change.</li>
    </ul>
