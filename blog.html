        <li>I was familiar with much of the basic html language so writing this assignment didn't take to much trouble. The thing that I had difficulties with was figuring out who to set up the git web pages and being able to edit in visual studio. I eventually figured it out though as you can see with these pages.</li>
        <li>I think the thing that I really took away from this asignment was just to refamiliarize myself with html overall and since i've been refreshed I am excited for the rest of the course.</li>
        <li>One website I used called w3schools had a lot of bennificial information on how to insert images and links to other pages</li>
